This repo contains my personal configurations for the tools i use in Linux, Mac and Windows. The configurations for some tools are mostly shared but for those that are specifics of on OS i will be splitted in the directory like in the case of wezterm, as currently there is no viable option for multiplexing in the terminal like tmux or zellij for windows, wezterm fulfills this requirement quite well, so it has its special configuration to split in panels and move around them in windows.

Feel free to use any of this configs if you find them suitable.
